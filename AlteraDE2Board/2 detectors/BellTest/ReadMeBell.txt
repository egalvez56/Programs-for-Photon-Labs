Read Me - Bell test

Two programs are available:

Bell_Manual_Altera 
     It allows paused measurements and recording of the data to perform the Bell test.

Bell_Automatic_Altera
     It takes the 16 measurements needed for a Bell CHSH. It uses a particular set of angles that show a maximal violation for the state HH+VV. It then computes the test's S parameter, which should be less than 2 for local realism to exist. The maximal violation is 2.8. The program works with an apparatus with two fixed polarizers preceded by rotatable half-wave plates. The waveplates are mounted on a motorized mount from Pacific Laser Inc., where the minimum step is 1/9 of a degree (nod). 

Bell_Automatic_AlteraAnyAngles
     It takes data for a Bell test for any angle specified in the initial prompt and calculates the Bell parameter S. It assumes Pacific Laser rotational mounts.
