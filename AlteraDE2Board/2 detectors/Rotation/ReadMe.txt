    RotationalCosineFitAltera	
  This program takes data while rotating an optical element. It is useful for calibrating the zero of a waveplate. For example, if the photons are linearly polarized, then scanning a polarizer will produce a cosine-type curve. A fit of the function gives the setting for the angle of the transmission axis of the polarizer. We use Pacific Laser rotational mounts, where you specify the absolute angle of the mount but can manually redefine the zero. So, the program lets one find the zero with the data itself.
