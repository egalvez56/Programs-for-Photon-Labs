Piezo programs scan the voltage that is applied to a piezoelectric. This normally occurs when the piezo electric is a spacer on a stage that is part of an interferometer. That way the phase of the interference is scanned via a change in the path length difference. There are two different programs:
    PiezoScan_2Detectors_Altera
    PiezoScan2Det23VR
